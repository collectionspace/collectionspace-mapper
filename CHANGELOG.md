## [4.0.2] - 2022-06-07
Uses Zeitwerk eager loading (and custom inflection on version.rb to VERSION) to make `rails:zeitwerk` check pass when used with collectionspace-csv-importer.

## [4.0.1] - 2022-05-23

See [PR 138](https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/pull/138) for more details on changes.

### Changed
- BUGFIX: Fixes error that could occur if an unknown term using different cases (i.e. U.S. Equestian Team vs. U.S. Equestrian team). TermHandler would check whether the second value was cached as unknown with case-swapping, and would return true. However, when actually fetching the cached value, case-swapping wasn't used, so a nil value would be returned and passed on, later causing a MethodMissing on nil error.

## [4.0.0] - 2022-05-13

See [PR 137](https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/pull/137) for more details on changes.

### Breaking
- Initializing a `DataHander` now requires a `csid_cache` in addition to (refname) `cache` parameter.

### Added
- Rspec binstub
- New configuration option: `status_check_method` (defaults to `client`, but may be also set to `cache` for use with `collectionspace_migration_tools` (and code to support this configurable functionality)
- New configuration option: `search_if_not_cached` (defaults to `true`, but may be set to `false` for use with `collectionspace_migration_tools` (and code to support this configurable functionality)

### Changed
- Initializing a `DataHander` now requires a `csid_cache` in addition to (refname) `cache` parameter.
- Use `zeitwerk` for autoloading
- Refactoring to support configurable record status checkig via client API calls or cache
- When searching for relations (`client.find_relation`), sends the relation type
- All searching of CS instance moved to use `collectionspace-client` instead of `collectionspace-refcache`'s fallback searching. All search functionality has been removed from `collectionspace-refcache`
- All record status check logic moved out of `DataHandler`
- Test style consistency improved, and `integration` tag added to tests that compare full record mappings to fixture XML

### Deleted

## [3.0.0] - 2022-01-20

See [PR 136](https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/pull/136) for more details on changes.

### Breaking
- `check_terms` batch configuration option is removed, as it is inherently unsafe
- Changes introduced will prevent `collectionspace-csv-importer` users from transferring records they previously were able to transfer

### Added
- Searching for "case-swapped" versions of terms not found in cache or target CS instance

### Changed
- Attaches an error, rather than a warning, to responses returned to `collectionspace-csv-importer` when record data includes authority or vocabulary terms that do not yet exist in target CS instance. This has the effect of preventing transfer of these records
- Both refname and csid of existing terms are cached on first lookup
- Terms or records found to be missing from target CS instance are cached as `unknownvalue` type entries
- Improved test coverage

### Deleted
- `check_terms` batch configuration option

Details: https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/compare/v2.5.2...v3.0.0

## [2.5.2] - 2022-01-14
### Added
- `strip_id_values` batch configuration option added. Setting this to `false` allows update of existing records with leading/trailing spaces on the record ID field values.

## [2.5.1] - 2021-10-13
### Changed
- accept and handle collectionspace-refcache passed in from collectionspace-csv-importer
- bug fixes for dealing with cached data
- refactoring

## [2.5.0] - 2021-09-23
### Added
- `multiple_recs_found` batch configuration option added to allow batch deletion of duplicate records. This defaults to `fail`, which means if there are two or more existing records sharing the same ID, the batch importer will not transfer anything for that ID. In rare cases, however, you may really need to delete duplicates, and now you can. The batch importer will transfer your update or delete to the first result found via a search for the record ID. See [the batch configuration options documentation](https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/blob/main/doc/batch_configuration.adoc) for more information.

### Changed
- Do not warn about "%NULLVALUE%" as an unknown option list value

## [2.4.9] - 2021-09-03
### Changed
- Use Ruby 2.7.4 to stay in sync with collectionspace-csv-importer

## [2.4.8] - 2021-09-03
### Changed
- Bugfix for [collectionspace-csv-importer#110](https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-csv-importer/issues/110)
- Re-set up running tests automatically on PR creation
- Use `collectionspace-client` v0.10.0 and the `find_relation` method added to it
- Use `collectionspace-refcache` v0.7.7
- Add tests for methods in `TermSearchable` module

## [2.4.7] - 2021-07-14
### Changed
- Use ruby v2.7.3
- Use `collectionspace-client` v0.9.0
- Use `collectionspace-refcache` v0.7.6

## [2.4.6] - 2021-07-13
### Changed
- `mediaFileURI` is included in the list of known columns for media procedure records.

## [2.4.5] - 2021-06-29
### Changed
- Bumps version of `collectionspace-client` to 0.8.0, to add support for all 6.1 record types and new 7.0 record types
- Bumps version of `collectionspace-refcache` to 0.7.4, which now also depends on `collectionspace-client` 0.8.0
- Sorts Dir files before requiring them to avoid load-order problems that are tricky to reproduce
- Explicitly requires dependent files to fix failures highlighted by introducing sort before requiring

Details: https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/compare/v2.4.4...v2.4.5

## [2.4.4] - 2021-06-21
### Added
- `Tools::RecordStatusService` raises `NoClientServiceError` instead of passing along a mysterious, hard to debug `KeyError`. This allows `collectionspace-csv-importer` to fail with an informative message.

Details: https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/compare/v2.4.3...v2.4.4

## [2.4.3] - 2021-06-21
### Changed
- Bumps version of `collectionspace-refcache` to 0.7.3, as this is the version now required by `collectionspace-csv-importer` for playing nice with Heroku

Details: https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/compare/v2.4.2...v2.4.3

## [2.4.2] - 2021-06-07
### Added
- Test coverage for %NULLVALUE% authority terms in repeating subgroups

### Changed
- Refactored core mapper tests

Details: https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/compare/v2.4.1...v2.4.2

## [2.4.1] - 2021-06-02
### Added
- Tests for vocabulary/authority-controlled fields containing %NULLVALUE% and THE BOMB

### Changed
- Term handler now passes through %NULLVALUE% as an empty string, and passes ðŸ’£ through as ðŸ’£. This means you no longer get spurious "not found" term warnings about these values, and they have the expected result when imported.

Details: https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/compare/v2.4.0...v2.4.1

## [2.4.0] - 2021-05-17
### Added
- Public `DataHandler.service_type` method so that `cspace-batch-import` does not reach into the guts of the class for that info

Details: https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/compare/v2.3.2...v2.4.0

## [2.3.1], [2.3.2] - 2021-05-17
### Deleted
- Development dependency on ruby-prof that should not have been committed

Details: https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/compare/v2.3.0...v2.3.2

## [2.3.0] - 2021-05-17
### Added
- Implements "the bomb" for deleting existing field values. See [the PR](https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/pull/108) for details.
- This release also includes unreleased refactored code from 2.2.6

Details: https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/compare/v2.2.5...v2.3.0

## [2.2.6 (Unreleased)] - 2021-04-30
### Changed
- Refactoring

## [2.2.5] - 2021-04-22
### Added
- CHANGELOG.md

### Changed
- BUGFIX: Fixes an issue where, when many records are mapped using the same `DataHandler`, some XML records were missing expected elements.

### Deleted
- Tests for UCB-specific mapping. These tests had served their purpose, were no longer needed, and were not worth fixing when they started to fail because the dev instance on UCB's end changed or went away.

Details: https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/compare/v2.2.3...v2.2.5

## [2.2.4 (Unreleased)] - 2021-03-25

- Updated values in fixtures causing test failures due to records being deleted from CollectionSpace dev instance

## [2.2.3] - 2021-03-09
### Changed
- BUGFIX: Spurious warnings about subgroup overflows are no longer emitted

Details: https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/compare/v2.2.2...v2.2.3
