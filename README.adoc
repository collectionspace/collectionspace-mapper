= Collectionspace::Mapper

== Role in CollectionSpace ecosystem

The full ecosystem of the CollectionSpace "batch data stack" is described https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace_migration_tools/blob/main/doc/foundation_concepts.adoc[here].

*`collectionspace-mapper` takes a JSON RecordMapper for a CollectionSpace record type and a record data hash (which is usually derived from a row of CSV data) and creates a CollectionSpace XML record.*

`collectionspace-mapper` also validates the given data, ensuring any required field is present before mapping. The response returned by `collectionspace-mapper` also includes data quality warnings that a user may want to fix before adding the record to CollectionSpace.

`collectionspace-mapper` is used by:

* https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-csv-importer[collectionspace-csv-importer]
* https://github.com/lyrasis/collectionspace_migration_tools[collectionspace_migration_tools]
