  "recordStatus": "approved",
  "briefDescription": "Tibetan prayer wheel; plain on the outside, but with a tightly wound scroll, carefully enclosed in a sewn cloth sheath, and fit precisely to the copper cylinder. It spins easily on an ingeniously crafted bearing made of carved wood and shell, and is able to facilitate millions of revolutions without breaking down or causing undue friction. A coil of mantras, often hundreds of thousands of mantras, printed from wood blocks on long scrolls, is within the copper cylinder.",
