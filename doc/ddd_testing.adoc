= Testing instructions for DDD

== Background
https://www.collectionspace.org/[CollectionSpace] is a collections management application for museums.

We are currently in the middle of an upgrade from CollectionSpace 6.0 to 6.1. *Our work here will focus on version 6.1.*

=== Profiles

Since there are very different types of museum collections (art museum vs. local history museum vs. botanical garden), CollectionSpace offers several different data profiles, all based on the core CollectionSpace profile.

|====================
| Profile | Demo site | Dev site

| Core | https://core.collectionspace.org | https://core.dev.collectionspace.org
| Anthropology  | https://anthro.collectionspace.org | https://anthro.dev.collectionspace.org
| Bonsai  | https://bonsai.collectionspace.org | https://bonsai.dev.collectionspace.org
| Botanical garden  | https://botgarden.collectionspace.org | https://botgarden.dev.collectionspace.org
| Fine & contemporary art  | https://fcart.collectionspace.org | https://fcart.dev.collectionspace.org
| Herbarium  | https://herbarium.collectionspace.org | https://herbarium.dev.collectionspace.org
| Local history & material culture  | https://lhmc.collectionspace.org | https://lhmc.dev.collectionspace.org
| Materials  | https://materials.collectionspace.org | https://materials.dev.collectionspace.org
| Public art  | https://publicart.collectionspace.org | https://publicart.dev.collectionspace.org
|====================

[NOTE]
====
The user name and password for the demo and dev sites are given on the login page. The username follows a consistent pattern across the profiles, and the password for all is the same. The login for demo and dev sites for each profile is the same.
====


[NOTE]
====
The bottom right corner of the login screen tells you the release of CollectionSpace used.

As of 2020-08-31, the demo sites are running 6.0 and the dev sites are running 6.1. *Since we are focusing on 6.1, start off using the dev sites.*

_*If the upgrade is completed during the time you are working on this project, you may see the dev sites jump to 6.2, in which case, you should start using the demo sites which will then be running 6.1.*_

=== Record types

There are three main types of record in CollectionSpace: collectionobject, procedure, and authority. To view any record type, open CollectionSpace, click `Create New`, and choose the record type.

collectionobject:: Also called "object" or "cataloging," this record describes an object in a museum's collection. This is the most complex record, with the most fields.
procedure:: A record of this type describes some action taken on an object or group of objects, such as acquisition, conservation activities, exhibition, or movement from one location to another. A procedure record is almost always linked to one or more object records. Procedure records may also be linked to each other. For example, if an object is moved for an exhibition, the movement record and exhibition record may be linked. 
authority:: A record of this type describes a term in a controlled vocabulary (concept, person, geographic place, storage location, etc.). Terms represented by an authority record may be used as values in fields in other records. Some fields require use of an authority term.

There are also vocabulary records, which we tend to deal with only indirectly. A vocabulary is sort of a lightweight version of an authority. It is a controlled term list, but not as much information can be recorded about a term. Some fields require use of a vocabulary term. To view vocabularies and terms in them, log into CollectionSpace, click `Tools`, and click `Term Lists` if you are not already on that tab.

Users with certain permission levels can add new authority and vocabulary terms in the CollectionSpace user interface.

There is another type of controlled term list that must be configured in the CollectionSpace application configuration. This is the "option list." Some fields require option list terms. 

An overview of the different profiles and record types is available on the https://collectionspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COL/pages/506953729/Configuration+and+Data+Maps+-+Cataloging+Procedures+and+Vocabularies[CollectionSpace wiki]. A comprehensive, sortable, filterable list of all fields in all record types in all profiles is available https://github.com/collectionspace/cspace-config-untangler/blob/master/data/fields_6_1_dates_collapsed.csv[here].


== This project

We are building a new batch data import tool that will allow CollectionSpace users to ingest new records or update existing records in bulk, by uploading a CSV file. The working documentation and discussion of the functional design for this tool https://collectionspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COL/pages/1267236875/CSV+Import+Tool[is available] if you are interested, but *you do not need to look at it*.

This repo represents _one piece_ of this batch data import tool. See https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/blob/master/README.md[the main repo README file] for a description of what this piece does and how it fits in with the rest.

*The objective of your work on this project is to increase automated test coverage for the code in this repo.* This will include:

- creation of sample CollectionSpace record and saving XML representation of that record via the API
- creation of sample data that would result in that CollectionSpace record
- set up of tests using the sample data and CollectionSpace XML

More details on these steps below!

There are some known issues in the current code, and new tests that fail will help us uncover others, as well as to maintain the functionality of the code as changes are made going forward.


== Getting started

- https://github.com/collectionspace/collectionspace-mapper/blob/master/doc/setup_for_development.adoc[Get set up for development]

== Organizing the work (+ useful reference info)

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nhJRbgGjl7ZCTNlFFI1PnrpoJe-fDML5zMrS275HS3Q/edit?usp=sharing[Google Sheets file for organizing the work]

I gave Erick, Kevin, and Onesmus permission to edit the file, so the link should work for you if you log in with a Google account linked to your DDD email.

CollectionSpace isn't always totally consistent, so this spreadsheet also serves as a reference for the internal/code names of different record types, how those record types are _usually_ displayed in the UI, and the pattern for using the CollectionSpace API to retrieve an XML version of a record created in the application.

Priority 1 is highest priority. I will add numbers as the work proceeds.

Put your name in the `claimed_by` column before starting work on a record type, so work doesn't get duplicated.
